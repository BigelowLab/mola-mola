## Overview
Here we present a possible workflow for modeling and predicting human interactions with the world's largest bony fish, the [*Mola mola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_sunfish).  We'll use R and a number of important packages to retrieve observations from [OBIS](https://obis.org/taxon/127405), sea surface temperature from [OISST](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/optimum-interpolation-sst) and [NBS v2](https://coastwatch.noaa.gov/cwn/products/noaa-ncei-blended-seawinds-nbs-v2.html).  With these we'll build a presence-only model using a pure-R implementation of [MaxEnt](https://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent/).  We'll also try our hand at predicting (hindcast).

### Handling spatial data

In this tutorial we use the [sf](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sf) and [stars](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stars) packages to handle spatial data.  These tutorials [for sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) and [for stars](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/) will help you off to a great start.



### Project-specific functions

We have developed a suite of functions that facilitate acccessing and working with data.  These can be loaded into your R session by `source()`-ing the `setup.R` file.  Here's an example where we show the study area using the ancillary function `get_bb()` to retrieve the project's bounding box.

```{r}
#| cache: true
source("setup.R", echo = FALSE)
bb = get_bb(form = 'polygon')
coast = rnaturalearth::ne_coastline(scale = 'large', returnclass = 'sf')
plot(sf::st_geometry(coast), extent = bb, axes = TRUE, reset = FALSE)
plot(bb, lwd = 2, border = 'orange', add = TRUE)
```

The setup file also checks for the required packages, and will attempt to install them into the user's R library directory if not already installed.

### Fetching data

The [robis](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=robis) package facilitates easy access to [OBIS](https://obis.org/) which is a huge public database for oceanographic species information.  We have written a wrapper function to download the *Mola mola* species records in our study region. To simplify our task we drop may columns of data from that delivered by OBIS, but there is much in the original worth exploring. Note you can use this function to access other species in other parts of the world.

Note that we have already fetched the data, so we don't run this next step (but you can if you like to get updated data.)
```
x = fetch_obis()
```

Since we already have the data, we need only read it.

```{r read_obis}
x = read_obis() |>
  dplyr::glimpse()
```

Let's see what we found on the map.

```{r}
plot(sf::st_geometry(coast), extent = bb, axes = TRUE, reset = FALSE)
plot(bb, lwd = 2, border = 'orange', add = TRUE)
plot(sf::st_geometry(x), pch = "+", col = 'blue', add = TRUE)
```

Uhoh, there's one somewhere in Connecticut.  Well, we'll deal with that later.

### Data storage

We have set up a data directory, `data`, for storing data collected for the project.  To start out there isn't much more than the downloaded data set, but we'll added to it as we go.

```{r}
fs::dir_tree("data", recurse = TRUE)
```
