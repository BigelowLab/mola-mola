Here we try our hand with the [tidysdm](https://evolecolgroup.github.io/tidysdm/), which is a Species Distribution Modeling ("sdm") wrapper around and extension of  the [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) suite of R packages. We'll walk through the steps shown in [tidysdm's overview vignette](https://evolecolgroup.github.io/tidysdm/articles/a0_tidysdm_overview.html) using our `Mola mola` dataset. We already have a good sense of our obseravtions and covariates so we can skip the [data preparation](https://evolecolgroup.github.io/tidysdm/articles/a0_tidysdm_overview.html#preparing-your-data) steps.

::: {.callout-important}
First we need to install a [developmental version of tidysdm](https://github.com/EvolEcolGroup/tidysdm).  The `dev` branch is subject to a [pull request](https://github.com/EvolEcolGroup/tidysdm/pull/57); it has been accepted into the upstream repos and it will work its way into a CRAN release.

```
remotes::install_github("EvolEcolGroup/tidysdm", ref = "dev")
```

Similar to our traditional approach, we can look at the major steps of

+ data preparation (whihc includes thinning)

+ background point selection and covariate analysis

+ modeling
